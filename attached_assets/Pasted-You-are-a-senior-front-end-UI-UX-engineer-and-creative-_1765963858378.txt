You are a senior front-end UI/UX engineer and creative technologist.

I already have an existing event website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Do NOT remove or break any existing structure, logic, IDs, classes, or backend connections.

Your task is to detect the current layout and styles and then enhance the visual experience while keeping everything functional.

🌌 BACKGROUND (LIVE + FUTURISTIC)

Add a live animated background that feels:

futuristic

cyber / tech-event themed

energetic but not distracting

Background ideas you may choose from (pick the most suitable):

animated particles network

slow moving glowing dots & lines

subtle matrix-style digital rain (very light)

gradient-based motion background with depth

Background must:

be GPU friendly

not affect text readability

work smoothly on laptops and mobiles

Use Canvas / CSS animations / lightweight JS only

Add a dark futuristic color palette (deep blues, purples, cyan accents)

🧠 FONT & TYPOGRAPHY

Replace existing fonts with modern futuristic fonts, such as:

Orbitron

Inter

Poppins

Space Grotesk

Rules:

Headings should look bold, techy, and exciting

Body text must be clean, readable, and user-friendly

Maintain proper line spacing and font hierarchy

Do not make text too thin or flashy

🧩 LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS

Improve spacing, alignment, and section flow

Use:

glassmorphism or soft card effects

smooth rounded corners

subtle shadows and glow effects

Keep layout:

responsive

easy to navigate

exciting for participants visiting an event site

Important buttons and sections should visually stand out

✨ INTERACTIONS & FEEL

Add:

smooth hover animations

soft transitions on buttons, cards, and sections

subtle glowing effects on important actions

Avoid:

heavy animations

flashing or distracting motion

The website should feel alive but professional

🛡️ SAFETY & PERFORMANCE

Do NOT:

break existing functionality

remove scripts or backend links

increase page load time drastically

Ensure:

fast loading

mobile responsiveness

accessibility (contrast & readability)
