🔐 FINAL MASTER PROMPT
(ADMIN-ONLY PANEL + LOCKED ROUNDS + PROPER AUTHORIZATION)

Role:
You are a senior full-stack developer and system security architect.

Goal:
Build a secure event web application for “Decode & Dominate” where:

The Admin Panel is accessible ONLY to organizers

Normal users can NEVER access admin features

Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3 are locked by default

Only admin-authenticated and authorized participants can access allowed rounds

🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION (MANDATORY)

Implement login using username and password

Every participant must log in using credentials created and approved by the Admin

Participants cannot self-register

Without admin-approved credentials, login must be denied

Each logged-in user must have:

A role (admin or participant)

Individual round permissions (round1, round2, round3)

Authentication alone is NOT enough
The backend must strictly enforce role-based and permission-based authorization

👤 USER ROLES
🧑‍💼 ADMIN (Organizer)

Can access the Admin Panel

Can create participant accounts individually

Assign:

Username

Password

Round access permissions

Can enable or disable:

Round 1

Round 2

Round 3

Can monitor live anti-cheat status

Has full control over access and attempts

👥 PARTICIPANT (User)

Can log in only with admin-provided credentials

Can access only the rounds explicitly enabled by admin

Must never see or access admin routes or admin UI

Any unauthorized access attempt must be blocked

🛑 STRICT ROUTE PROTECTION (CRITICAL)

The backend must verify on every request:

User is logged in

User role is correct

User has permission for the requested round

If a participant manually enters:

/admin → return 403 Forbidden

/round1, /round2, /round3 without permission → Access Denied

Frontend checks alone are NOT trusted

🔒 ROUND LOCKING BEHAVIOR

All rounds are locked by default

A participant sees:

“Access Locked by Organizer” if not authorized

Round pages load only after backend approval

🧭 DASHBOARD LAYOUT

Right-side fixed dashboard

Left-side dynamic content loaded from backend routes

Dashboard must display:

Logged-in username

Role (Admin / Participant)

Round access status (Locked / Unlocked)

🛠️ ADMIN PANEL (ORGANIZER ONLY)

Separate admin dashboard

Features:

Create users individually

Assign username and password

Enable or disable Round 1 / 2 / 3 per user

Lock or unlock attempts at any time

Changes must apply immediately without restart

📡 LIVE ANTI-CHEAT PANEL (ADMIN SIDE ONLY)

Continuously updated admin dashboard

Displays:

Active users

Current round

Violation status (Tab switch / Screenshot / Normal)

Participants must NEVER access this panel

🚫 ANTI-CHEAT ENFORCEMENT (PARTICIPANTS)

Disable copy & paste

Disable right-click

Detect tab switching or window blur → report to backend

Detect screenshot keys → report to backend

Backend logs violations in real time

⚙️ TECH CONSTRAINTS

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js + Express OR Python Flask

Backend must enforce all security rules

Frontend checks alone are NOT sufficient
