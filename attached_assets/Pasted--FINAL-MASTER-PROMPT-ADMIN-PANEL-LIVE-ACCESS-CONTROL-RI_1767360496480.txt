🧠 FINAL MASTER PROMPT
(ADMIN PANEL + LIVE ACCESS CONTROL + RIGHT DASHBOARD)

Role:
You are a senior full-stack developer and system architect.

Goal:
Build a secure, cyber-themed dashboard web application for an event called “Decode & Dominate” with:

A right-side dashboard

Backend-driven page loading

A live admin panel that controls who can access which round

🎨 THEME & UI (MANDATORY)

KIITFEST-inspired purple cyber theme

Dark violet / black background

Purple & magenta neon glow

Subtle binary / tech patterns

Glassmorphism or glowing cards

Monospace / tech fonts

🧭 GLOBAL LAYOUT
🔹 LEFT SIDE (Dynamic Content – 70–75%)

Loads content from backend routes

Routes:

/round1

/round2

/round3

Page content loads only if user is authorized

🔹 RIGHT SIDE (Fixed Dashboard – 25–30%)

Always visible

Shows:

Event name

Logged-in username

Navigation buttons

Current round access status

🔐 AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Login required before accessing any round

Username + Password authentication

Credentials stored securely in backend

No public access to rounds

👤 USER ROLES
🔹 ADMIN (Organizer)

Full access

Can log in to Admin Panel

🔹 PARTICIPANT (Teams / Individuals)

Can only access rounds explicitly allowed by admin

🛠️ ADMIN PANEL (CORE REQUIREMENT)

Create a separate Admin Dashboard accessible only to admin credentials.

Admin Panel Features:

User Management

Create users manually

Assign:

Username

Password

Team Name

Team ID

Round Access Control (VERY IMPORTANT)

Admin can individually enable or disable:

Round 1 access

Round 2 access

Round 3 access

Each user/team has separate access flags

Example:

Team A → Round 1 ✅, Round 2 ❌, Round 3 ❌

Team B → Round 1 ✅, Round 2 ✅, Round 3 ❌

Live Updates

Changes made by admin reflect immediately

No server restart required

Dashboard updates continuously

Attempt Control

Admin can:

Allow attempt

Lock attempt

Disqualify user

🚫 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT LOGIC

If user tries to access a round without permission:

Show “Access Denied by Organizer”

Backend must verify permissions before serving page

Frontend alone is NOT trusted

🧩 ROUND PAGES (BACKEND-LOADED)
/round1 – FastTrack Quiz

Accessible only if admin enables Round 1 for that user

/round2 – Code Debugging

Accessible only after admin approval

/round3 – Web Cloning

Accessible only for qualified users

🔐 ANTI-CHEAT FEATURES (PARTICIPANT SIDE)

Implement JavaScript-based monitoring:

Disable copy & paste

Disable right-click

Detect tab change / window blur → auto refresh

Detect screenshot keys → warning + refresh

Optional fullscreen enforcement

📊 ADMIN LIVE MONITORING (OPTIONAL BUT VALUABLE)

Show:

Logged-in users

Active round per user

Attempt status (Active / Locked)

⚙️ TECH STACK

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js + Express OR Python Flask

Database:

JSON / SQLite / MongoDB

Clean structure:

/routes

/controllers

/views

/static
