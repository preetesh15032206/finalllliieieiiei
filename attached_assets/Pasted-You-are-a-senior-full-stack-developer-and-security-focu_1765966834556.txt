You are a senior full-stack developer and security-focused system designer.

I am building an event website with multiple rounds.
The website already has an existing frontend and backend.
Do NOT break or rewrite existing code unless necessary. Detect and integrate with existing structure.

Your task is to design and implement a secure submission system with proctoring features and admin controls, as described below.

🔐 SUBMISSION SYSTEM (ROUND-WISE)
📄 Round 2: PDF Solution Submission

When a user clicks “Submit PDF Solution”:

Show a secure submission form that collects:

Participant ID (this ID will be provided by me)

PDF file upload

On submit:

Store the PDF securely in server storage

Save metadata in the database:

participant_id

round_number = 2

file_path / file_name

timestamp

submission_status

Validate:

Only PDF allowed

File size limit

One submission per participant (unless admin allows resubmission)

🔗 Round 3: Repository Link Submission

When user clicks “Submit Repo Link”:

Show a form with:

Participant ID

Repository URL (GitHub/GitLab/etc.)

On submit:

Save to database:

participant_id

round_number = 3

repo_link

timestamp

Validate:

Proper URL format

Prevent empty or duplicate submissions

🗄️ DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

Design database tables (or integrate with existing ones) such as:

submissions

id

participant_id

round_number

submission_type (pdf / repo)

submission_value (file path or link)

timestamp

status

Ensure data is:

persistent

secure

queryable by admin dashboard

🛡️ PROCTORING / PROTECTION MODE (FRONTEND + JS)

When Protector Mode is ENABLED, enforce the following:

🚫 Copy–Paste Protection

Disable:

Ctrl+C

Ctrl+V

Right-click

Text selection (optional, based on page)

🔄 Tab Change Detection

Detect when:

User switches tabs

Browser window loses focus

Log:

participant_id

event type (tab switch)

timestamp

Optional behavior:

warning popup

auto refresh

auto submission (configurable)

📸 Screenshot / Screen Capture Detection

Detect:

PrintScreen key

Screenshot attempts (best-effort via JS visibility & key detection)

On detection:

Log violation

Show warning

Optional auto refresh

(Note: Mention browser limitations clearly but implement best possible detection.)

🔁 Refresh / Navigation Control

Detect:

Page refresh

Back / forward navigation

Handle:

warning message

state preservation if allowed

logging of behavior

🧑‍💼 ADMIN CONTROL PANEL

Create an Admin Toggle Button / Switch:

🔘 Protector Mode ON / OFF

Admin can:

Enable protector mode globally

Disable protector mode globally

State should be:

Stored in database

Fetched dynamically by frontend

When OFF:

All restrictions are disabled

When ON:

All restrictions activate instantly

Admin panel should:

Be secure

Not accessible to participants

Reflect real-time protector status

⚡ UX & FEEDBACK

Clear messages for:

Successful submission

Errors

Violations

UI should feel:

futuristic

professional

exam / event-like

No intrusive alerts unless necessary

🛠️ TECH CONSTRAINTS

Use:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)

Backend compatible with existing stack

Do NOT:

hardcode participant IDs

expose admin routes

store files on client side

Ensure:

performance

security

mobile + desktop compatibility
